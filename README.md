1. Project Title : ​ Traffic Sign Recognition

2. Gist About the Project​ : You must have heard about self-driving cars in which the
passenger can fully depend on the car for traveling. But to achieve level 5 autonomous,
it is necessary for vehicles to understand and follow all traffic rules.
In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in technologies, many
researchers and big companies like Tesla, Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota,
Ford, Audi, etc are working on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. So, for
achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should be able to interpret traffic
signs and make decisions accordingly.

3. ​ Technologies Used :​ ​ In this project , I will build a deep neural network model that
can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, I
am able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all
autonomous vehicles.
(Numpy, Pandas, Pillow, sklearn. Tkinter, keras)

4. ​ Conclusion : ​ I have successfully classified the traffic signs classifier with 95%
accuracy and also visualized how our accuracy and loss changes with time, which is
pretty good from a simple CNN model.

5.​ Future Scope :​ We can create an app and can easily detect traffic signs using
mobile camera.Hence we can operate vehicles using mobile app.
